It has been difficult to write recently. So, starting with this post, I am
trying something new. As an experiment, I will be posting at least once a
week about my reading for that week. Whether it was a book, an article, a blog
post, documentation, paper or video, my goal is write about it here. This is
partially as a hedge against link rot and mind rot, as I frequently find myself
casting back in twitter and google to find that thing that I read that time
about that person and that thing.

We will see how this goes.
