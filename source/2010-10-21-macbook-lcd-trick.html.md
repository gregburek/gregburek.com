*UPDATED Nov 2011*: I found a better way to do this that is posted
[here](/2011/11/09/Lid-open-display-off)

Up until now, I have run my laptop at work with the lid closed and everything
on an external monitor on my desk.  However, I was starting to get really
concerned about the heat (60C idle and 95C under load) and how the little fan
was struggling to keep up.

So, I started looking around for tips about how to leave the lid open, but
trick my MacBook into thinking the lid was closed and leave the LCD off.  I
found a few [good](http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=9390796

MacBook's Lid"), but I still had to hunt with a magnet for that magical switch
point. Well, I found it and the picture is below.  Things look pretty frosty so
far, let's hope this extends the life of my 3 year old laptop a bit more.
