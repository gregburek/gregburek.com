title: Exporting from Aperture 3.2 to Flickr with location information metadata
---

Over the month of October, I took an incredible trip to Singapore and Japan.
That trip deserves its own post, but until then,
[these](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gregburek/sets/72157628032336264/
"Singapore 2011 on Flickr")
[photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gregburek/sets/72157627963313507/ "Japan
2011 on Flickr") will have to suffice.

However, I ran into a little snag while editing and publishing everything. The
problem was that each photo's GPS/location data wasn't making the jump to
Flickr from Aperture. The solution was these two check boxes that needed to be
selected in order for the location info to be correctly exported: one in
Advanced Options and another in Export Preferences.

![Aperture Export Preferences][export]

So in the end, if you make sure "Include location information for published
photos" and "Include location info in exported photos" are both selected,
everything works beautifully.
