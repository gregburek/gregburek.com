[@t_crayford](https://twitter.com/t_crayford) sent me Brendan Gregg's latest
missive about performance tracing, this time for [Linux MySQL Slow Query Tracing with bcc/BPF](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2016-10-04/linux-bcc-mysqld-qslower.html).

READMORE

[bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) stands for 'BPF Compiler Collection' and
[BPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter) stands for
'Berkeley Packet Filter'. From the bcc
[README](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/60393ea5dd966d33ff24929f6981df09473cbb1b/README.md):

> BCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and manipulation
> programs, and includes several useful tools and examples. It makes use of
> extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters), formally known as eBPF, a new feature
> that was first added to Linux 3.15. Much of what BCC uses requires Linux 4.1
> and above.

> eBPF was [described](https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/14/232) by Ingo MolnÃ¡r as:

>> One of the more interesting features in this cycle is the ability to attach
>> eBPF programs (user-defined, sandboxed bytecode executed by the kernel) to
>> kprobes. This allows user-defined instrumentation on a live kernel image
>> that can never crash, hang or interfere with the kernel negatively.

> BCC makes BPF programs easier to write, with kernel instrumentation in C (and
> includes a C wrapper around LLVM), and front-ends in Python and lua. It is
> suited for many tasks, including performance analysis and network traffic
> control.

As I work for Heroku Postgres, I wanted to investigate something similar for
Postgres, running on our infrastructure. First thing to check was if it was
even possible on our systems, using [bcc's INSTALL
instructions](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/60393ea5dd966d33ff24929f6981df09473cbb1b/INSTALL.md).

New Postgres databases get Ubuntu Trusty instances with
`linux-generic-lts-xenial` kernels of the 4.4 series:

```
=> select version();
                                             version
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PostgreSQL 9.5.4 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) 4.8.2, 64-bit
(1 row)
```

```
~$ uname -a
Linux ip-10-0-10-230 4.4.0-38-generic #57~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Sep 6 17:20:43 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

This seems to satisfy the `Linux kernel version 4.1 or newer` requirement.

Next thing to check is if the kernel has been compiled properly:

```
~$ cat /boot/config-4.4.0-38-generic | grep BPF
CONFIG_BPF=y
CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_BPF=m
CONFIG_NET_CLS_BPF=m
CONFIG_NET_ACT_BPF=m
CONFIG_BPF_JIT=y
CONFIG_HAVE_BPF_JIT=y
CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS=y
CONFIG_TEST_BPF=m
```

This looks ok! Next up is to install the repo and tools:

```
~$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys D4284CDD

Now to test this out:

```
# /usr/share/bcc/tools/tplist -l /usr/lib/postgresql/9.5/bin/postgres
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/share/bcc/tools/tplist", line 16, in <module>
    from bcc import USDTReader
ImportError: cannot import name USDTReader
```

Welp. Looking at the source of [tplist on current master](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/6e60fbc8a672d8f29cab688ddc0df6d43a96c300/tools/tplist.py),
the [most recent commit](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/commit/69e361ac66fbf3baadb1f7cf21762df61ad7a5a9#diff-8189c35f15538919a795b3f18ad0db66L16)
removes `USDTReader`. Time to try the nightly builds:

```
~$ echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://repo.iovisor.org/apt/trusty trusty-nightly main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/iovisor.list
~$ sudo apt-get update
~$ sudo apt-get install bcc-tools
~$ sudo /usr/share/bcc/tools/tplist -l /usr/lib/postgresql/9.5/bin/postgres
'USDT' object has no attribute 'enumerate_probes'
```

Welp. `enumerate_probes` was added in another part of the [above patch](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/commit/69e361ac66fbf3baadb1f7cf21762df61ad7a5a9#diff-4cf0bde404ce4b67b2961b61419fa23fR58), so I think other things
need to be updated, as well.

One more error. This time in `libbcc`. Seems like another package to pull from nightly.

OK! No errors. This is good, as it answers my questions as to if this postgres
package was compiled with the `--enable-dtrace`. I can further confirm with
`readelf -n`

```
~$ readelf -n /usr/lib/postgresql/9.5/bin/postgres

```

There are no USDT or bpf traces found here, so next step is to recompile
postgres with `--enable-dtrace` and see what probes are available to use with
BPF (spoiler: [there are a lot of them](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/dynamic-trace.html)).
